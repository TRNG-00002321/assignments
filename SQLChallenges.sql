-- SETUP:
-- Create a database server (docker)
-- $ docker run --name some-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres 
--In our case it is MySQL
-- Connect to the server (Azure Data Studio / Database extension)
-- Test your connection with a simple query (like a select)
-- Execute the Chinook database (from the Chinook_pg.sql file to create Chinook resources in your server)

SELECT * FROM actor;
